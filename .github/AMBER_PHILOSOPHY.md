# Amber Philosophy H.R.T.

*It's all about the community. Software development is a team sport!*

It's not enough to be brilliant when you're alone in your programming lair. You are not going to change the world or delight millions of users by hiding and preparing your secret invention. We need to work with other members, we need to share our visions, divide the labor, learn from others, we need to be a team.

**HUMILITY** We are not the center of the universe. You're neither omniscient nor infallible. You are open to self-improvement.

**RESPECT** You genuinely care about others you work with. You treat them as human beings and appreciate their abilities and accomplishments.

**TRUST** You believe others are competent and will do the right thing, and you are OK with letting them drive when appropriate.
